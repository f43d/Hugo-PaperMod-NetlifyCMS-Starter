 ## [Top Five Regrets of the dying](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying)
1. I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
2. I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.
3. I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish I had let myself be happier.
